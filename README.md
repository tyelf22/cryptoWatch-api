# Frontend Review - Display Data from an API

For this assignment you will be doing a task that hopefully is second nature by now.

We will be displaying data on an HTML webpage from an API.

First choose an API. You cannot use the SWAPI or PokeAPI.

Here is a List of Public APIs that is awesome. I would recommend staying away from the ones that require auth. (However, if you are looking for a challenge, go for an api with auth. 2 points extra credit, if you use one that requires an API Key, 10 points extra credit if you can get one with OAuth working.)

Design a web app using that data on the client.

Host it using a tool like Netlify.

Requirements:

- Display 30 different object items from your chosen API
  - Each of the objects must display at least 3 data points
  - Example, if you where using the SWAPI you could display 30 starships with 3 data points about each one.
- Must include ability to search though the items
- Must be designed well.
  - Raw un-styled data will not be accepted.
